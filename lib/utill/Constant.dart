const String terms="If you're referring to a game concept called `Terms of Play,` it suggests there may be rules, conditions, or specific terms that players must adhere to during gameplay. This could be a strategic or thematic element where players navigate through challenges based on predefined rules or conditions.\n"
    "Here are a few ideas on how you could approach developing a game called 'Terms of Play':\n\n"
    "Rule-based Gameplay: Design a game where players must follow specific rules or conditions to progress. These rules could change dynamically or become more complex as the game advances.\n\n"
    "Negotiation or Agreement: Create a game where players negotiate terms with each other or with the game itself to achieve objectives. This could involve trade-offs, compromises, or strategic alliances.\n\n"
    "Contractual Challenges: Build a game where players sign contracts or agreements that dictate their actions and goals. The challenge could lie in fulfilling contractual obligations while navigating obstacles.\n\n"
    "Legal or Policy Simulation: Develop a game that simulates legal or policy-making processes, where players must navigate through terms, laws, or regulations to achieve specific outcomes.\n";
